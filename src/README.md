## Folder Structure

I built the folder structure on Domain Driven Design, additionally I'm not sure about the style file names. The stylelint in your GitHub organization did not allow me to save the files in the format I wanted.

## Codebase Maintainability

I wanted to use your eslint configuration as well, but I guess you didn't update it. So I used airbnb's.

## Tests

I added unit tests for project components.

## Project UI

There are storybooks of the components I wrote for the project.
I got the designs from a free design system on Figma Community.

  _I could use project management app (like Trello) but I got my notes there so I want you to see it too._
